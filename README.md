# 🏠 Forecasting House Prices Using Smart Regression Techniques

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to **accurately predict house prices** using advanced regression techniques in data science. Leveraging a structured housing dataset, we apply models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting to understand and forecast house prices effectively.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Forecast house prices based on historical and real estate data.
- Identify key features that influence house pricing.
- Implement and compare various regression models for prediction.
- Provide visual insights and recommendations for real-world application.

---

## 📊 Problem Statement

Accurate house price prediction helps stakeholders — buyers, sellers, banks, and investors — make informed decisions. By analyzing multiple features such as square footage, location, number of rooms, and year built, we can build predictive models that aid in smart real estate planning.

## 🧾 Dataset Description

Features from the dataset include:

- `SalePrice` – Target variable
- `GrLivArea` – Above-ground living area
- `YearBuilt` – Year the house was built
- `OverallQual` – Quality score
- `GarageCars`, `FullBath`, `Neighborhood`, etc.

---

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing

- Removed or imputed missing values.
- Dropped non-informative or high-missing columns.
- Normalized numerical features.
- Encoded categorical features using one-hot and ordinal encoding.

---

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis

- Histograms, boxplots, scatter plots
- Correlation matrix
- Outlier detection
- Insights into features with highest impact on price (e.g. `OverallQual`, `GrLivArea`)

---

## ⚖️ Feature Engineering

- Created new features like `TotalBathrooms`, `HouseAge`, `TotalSF`
- Applied log transformation to reduce skewness
- Removed multicollinearity and selected best features via Lasso, RF importance, and SelectKBest

---

## 🤖 Models Implemented

- **Linear Regression**
- **Ridge & Lasso Regression**
- **Decision Tree Regressor**
- **Random Forest Regressor**
- **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM)**

Evaluation Metrics:
- R² Score
- MSE / RMSE
- Cross-validation
